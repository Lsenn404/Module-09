## Description
Uses inquirer to prompt the user in the command line for information about their project. The information is then used to generate a README.md file for the project. Enter only your github username and email when prompted for the two as the link will be filled in automatically. Whichever license you choose will be added to the top of the README.md file as a badge. The video walkthrough will show you how to use the application.
